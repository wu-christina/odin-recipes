    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Serves: 4</h4>
        <h5>For the crispy shallots</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>250 ml neutral cooking oil (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>140 g shallots (or red onions), thinly sliced</li>
                
            </ul>
        <h5>For the pork</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>450 g pork belly, skin on</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>20 g rock sugar (or 1 tbsp white sugar)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Chinese five spice powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp ground white pepper</li>
                <li>5 dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated and diced</li>
                <li>4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>You also need</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>4 servings of plain steamed rice</li>
                <li>Blanched green vegetables (ex. Bok Choy, broccoli)</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h5>Fry the shallots</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up oil over medium heat. Add sliced shallots. Fry until they become golden and crispy.
                <li>Drain through a sieve. Set the shallots aside for later use. The oil can be used in other dishes (see note 2 to learn how).</li>
            </ol>
    
        <h5>Fry the pork</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut pork belly into strips. Put into an empty wok (without oil) over medium-high heat. Fry until the fat has been extracted and the meat browns slightly.</li>
                <li>Stir in garlic and rock sugar. Fry until fragrant and the sugar has melted.</li>
            </ol>
        <h5>Braise the pork</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, five-spice powder, white pepper, diced shiitake mushroom, fried shallots (leave some for topping) and hard-boiled eggs.</li>
                <li>Pour in the water in which the mushrooms were soaked. Top up with more water to immerse the meat completely.</li>
                <li>Bring it to a full boil. Turn the heat down to the lowest. Cover with the lid and leave to simmer for at least 1 hour until the pork becomes very tender (check the water level halfway through and top up if it seems too dry). This step can be done in a stovetop pressure cooker or an instant pot. Adjust time accordingly.</li>
                <li>If there is still quite a bit of liquid left, turn the heat to high and cook uncovered to reduce its volume and thicken (Do not dry it out though as you’d need some liquid to serve with the meat).</li>
            </ol>
        <h5>Assemble the dish</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Put freshly cooked rice in serving bowls. Top with blanched vegetable and halved eggs. Then spoon the pork, along with some thickened broth, over the rice. Add the rest of the fried shallots. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ul>
